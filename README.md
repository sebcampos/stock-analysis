# Stock-Analysis with VBA 

## Overview of Project
The Purpose of this project was to refactor a useful VBA function to so that it can be  efficently applicable on a much larger scale. Although the original function serves its purpose and  runs relativley quickly for a dataset of 12 stocks we will want to run it quickly as possible for thousands of stocks. Luckily in VBA there is a function to time the speed of our scripts. Our Goal will be to take the VBA functions and modify/refractor it to run at a faster rate which is testable by the previously mentioned function.
